Subject: [Awds-user] AWDS protocol with wifi managed Mode
Message-ID: <a14701250909070708m35e0ac38l7347bf01f2d6c322@mail.gmail.com>

Dear AWDS'r

I am trying to use the AWDS protocol with several interfaces. In order to
enable efficient bandwidth estimation, I am using the Managed Mode of WiFi.
Unfortunately the program didn't operate correctly (it actually detects the
neighbour and then lose the link instantly)

Someone already handles successfully this feature

Thanks and Best Regards

Djamal

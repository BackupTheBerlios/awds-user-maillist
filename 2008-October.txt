Subject: [Awds-user] Pb with Link detection
Message-ID: <a14701250810090217q467e8ed4ua616a17f44433627@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I am using AWDS to set up a wireless mesh backbone with heterogenous
technologies (Ethernet, WiFi). The protocole works more or less
correctly, I nevertheless noticed some bugs, I really appreciate if
you can help me to fix them out:

- WiFi links are not detected almost 1/2 of a time with high data rate
video traffic (ping pong effect). the pb don't happen with Ethernet
link
- The client cannot access the internet if he more then two hops far
then the gateway (TCP checksum pb with wireshark). I am using bridging
between the AWDS0 interface and the client interface
- The system works fine with 2 mesh router at the backbon, less stable
with three.


Finally, I have a doubt about the ETX metrics computations, at some
level I got some strange values (something like 40000000). Therfore, I
wonder why you choosed a customized method to compute the ETX (the
formulat used the value of 2048 and 32U), why not using just the basic
formula (1/Lf*Ld)

Best Regards

Djamal

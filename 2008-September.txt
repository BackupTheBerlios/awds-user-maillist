Hello,

     I read a post from March
(https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/awds-user/2008-March/000014.html)
about AWDS operating over bridges. At the same time I was
investigating the use of the Linux Ethernet Bridge
(http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Net:Bridge) with heterogeneous
networks, such as Ethernet, 802.11 ad hoc network and Bluetooth with
Ethernet Emulation (BNEP).

    The Ethernet Bridge guys claim that bridging Ethernet and 802.11
may be problematic because WDS would be needed and some card
manufacturers do not implement it at all. But I believe that AWDS
comes as an ideal match here? Has anyone ever tried to do something
similar before?

   Any comment would be great on this, I intend to run some tests on
real well-supported hardware to see if this is possible.

best regards,

This is a known problem, caused mainly by the address scheme. 802.11 maps the 
Ethernet addresses somehow to it own. However, there are some pitfalls, which 
often show up in poor implementations of wireless drivers.

AWDS encapsulates the whole Ethernet frame in its own format. To the user, the 
kernel, and the bridging code, it appears as a simple (virtual, tun) Ethernet 
device. Hence, bridging is no problem. 

Example of use:

We have an Intranet with DHCP-server and IPv6 router. 
We have some experimental mesh network with more or less 10 nodes permanently 
running. 

We bridge one nodes Ethernet port with the AWDS device and thus create a 
gateway. The Ethernet port is connected to the Intranet. This means: our mesh 
is now part of our intranet. All devices can get a IP address from the 
server, automatically receive an IPv6 address, etc. That's all.

It's really simple. Take two linux devices. Debian Linux is preferred, because 
we provide debian packages from our repository. Install the software, start 
the routing daemon, use the topoviewer to see if a topology is really 
established... 

If you encounter any problems, ask the friendly guys from this mailing list.

Thank you very much for your answer.

    I'm about to setup a test-bed to test exactly what you described.
But, I intend for have some control over the traffic coming in and
going out of the interfaces, especially from gateway (multi-interface)
nodes. I'd like to express something like: traffic coming from
interface eth0, now goes to interface awds0 (ad hoc network) or to
another interface available, based on some established condition (such
as link quality).

    I believe some hacking is necessary to do this, if someone could
give me hint to get me started I'd really appreciate. I'm still new to
AWDS and Linux Ethernet Bridging code.

best regards,

Message-ID: <c60ab7b20805050902s6cca5b27u38754e8fa49f91c2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'd like to run AWD on more than one interface, in particular on one
wireless and on one ethernet card;

I tried to modify the code of rawbasic.cc in this way (in this case I'm
running it on a PC with 2 eth cards)

GEA_MAIN_2(rawbasic, argc, argv)
{

    RawBasic *basic;
    RawBasic *basic1;

    const  char *netif = "eth0";
    const  char *netif1 = "eth1";

    if (argc > 1)
    {
        netif = argv[1];
    }

    basic = new RawBasic(netif);
    basic1 = new RawBasic(netif1);


    if (basic->raw_socket == -1)
    {
        GEA.dbg() << argv[0] <<
        ": cannot open raw socket interface on device " << netif <<
std::endl;
        return -1;
    }

    if (basic1->raw_socket == -1)
    {
        GEA.dbg() << argv[0] <<
        ": cannot open raw socket interface on device " << netif1 <<
std::endl;
        return -1;
    }

    //   basic->init(MyId);

    ObjRepository& rep = ObjRepository::instance();

    rep.insertObj("basic", "basic", (void*)basic);
    rep.insertObj("basic1", "basic", (void*)basic1);


    GEA.dbg() << "running RAW basic on " << basic->MyId << std::endl;
    GEA.dbg() << "running RAW basic on " << basic1->MyId << std::endl;


    //     basic->setSendDest(basic->BroadcastId);
    //     basic->sendHandle->write("Hallllllllllllllllllllo:  : ", 100);

    return 0;
}

and I obtain the following output:

test at DSK:~/AWDS/Packages/awds-7.6$ sudo start_awds
Starting AWDS on eth0
TcpShell listening...
running RAW basic on 000E0C633E6C
running RAW basic on 00188B8B3F4E
let's go!
created device awds0

The problem is that even If I create 2 sockets, the protocol sends the
beacons just on one interface; I tested it with wireshark;
So I guess I have to modify something in the awdsrouting.cc file; I'm
proceeding by steps, so I'd like to know what I should modify to make the
beacons sent on both the interfaces;

Thanks
Stefano

You also have to patch awdsrouting.cc to accept an argument, which
RawBasic instance to use. Then, you have to start two instances of
awdsrouting. Unfortunately, this will give you two different, separated
networks, which you already can achieve by starting two instances of
AWDS.

You could also modify awdsrouting.cc to use multiple RawBasic
interfaces. Then, you have to send broadcast packets over all
interfaces, and unicast packets over the interface where the neighbor is
actually located. As of now, this information is not stored in AWDS.
Instead, you would have to add another MAC lookup table there, or use a
modified Linux bridge over the two devices, where you disable packet
forwarding and only use it for determining the right interface for a
destination MAC. This might be possible even without modifying AWDS at
all.

The most elegant option is probably to include this functionality (MAC
lookup for unicat and usage of several sockets) into a new class
derived from RawBasic, which would transparently replace the old one.

There is also a multi-channel implementation of AWDS which already
supports using two different hardware interfaces. It is aimed at
increasing throughput when having two wireless NICs, but it might work
for your scenario. It contains a patched tapiface module to distribute
data over two different awdsrouting instances.

Contact me off-list if you would like to have the source / patch-set.

Kind regards,

Georg

I'd like to know how can I do to obtain the interface in which I received a
Beacon Packet. (In case we have more than one interface).
I tried to add something to recv_packet like (h == base->recvHandle) but I
get errors because it's a static member function.

It could be the NodeId of the interface or something else.

Thank you

Stefano

This looks promising.
The static member function means that you don't have the this pointer.
However, you have the /self/ pointer instead.

The function must be static, to create a function pointer on it.
Therefore, we have to add the /this/ pointer as void * parameter and we
have to call it /self/.

> It could be the NodeId of the interface or something else.
I think, using the Handle pointer as identifier is a good and efficient
way of identifying the interface.

Gruss

Andr?

Message-ID: <c60ab7b20805220237q5c79f98fnde7907b3b6699ae7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I was able to modify the code in a way to make it run on multiple inerface
(wired, wireless). The protocol looks like
working quite well (I tested it with video streaming between two nodes and 5
nodes between them). The problem is that if the wireless signal between two
neighbors drops down (to simulate this I simply take out the wireless card
from the node) it takes about 12 sec. to switch to the other wired interface
and
reach again the destination. Considering that the topology packet is sent
quite often I think the problem is due to the time taken to clean up
the table of neighbors. Do you know any way to reduce this time? Thank you.

Another question: in AwdsRouting.cc there is the member function
removeOldNeigh() , but it looks like it is not called by anywhere. What's it
purpose?

Stefano

Hi,

I have connected two laptops through an ethernet cable. I run the awds
protocol on both the machine and at a certain time I stop the
awds protocol on one of the 2 machines. Nevertheless I noticed that for at
least other 10 sec. after this, in the beacon packets of the
Node that is still running, there is still the turned off neighbor. How can
I do to reduce this time?

Thank you,

Stefano

I'd like to know how I can use the ETX Metric; is it sufficient to set up
the enum x_metric in routing.h?

No - thats old stuff which should have been removed from the source code
long time ago.

It is much easier: Just load the etxmetric module after the awdsrouting
module in start_awds. That's all.

Hi Georg,

I will be very grateful If you could send me the source / patch-set as you
said. I'm gonna try If it is suitable in a
heterogenous mesh network with wired and wireless interface.

Thanks,

<PRE>Hi Breno,

* Breno Jacinto &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/awds-user">breno at freeunix.com.br</A>&gt; [2008-12-23 13:05]:
&gt;<i>     I could not find the Wireshark dissector on the web page. Is it in
</I>&gt;<i> the downloads section?
</I>
It should be available from the berlios project downloads, or at least
from berlios SVN.

&gt;<i> - Is there any handling of split / merging of an ad hoc network?
</I>
This is a layer-2-problem, underneath of our own layer. There is no way
for AWDS to influence it. :(

However, after nights and nights of hacking on MadWifi, we have a driver
which has a remotely sane behaviour regarding IBSS merges.

Also, there is another Scapy script on my website, ibss-merge.scapy,
which analyzes beacon frames from adhoc nodes and shows their IBSS cell
ID to detect splits.

Freifunk has some experience with adhoc cell merging too, but they use
to set up all cards to a fixed BSSID (iwconfig wlanX ap 00:00:de:ad:be:ef
or something alike). I think they also have a tool doing something
similar to my ibss merge detector, called &quot;horst&quot;.

&gt;<i>     Great. Thanks for the nice set of tools. My intention is to have
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of cross-layering between layer 2 and 3.
</I>
Then the XML interface is probably the way to go, at least from L2 to L3.
For the other way around we are still looking for a coder to implement a
semi-generic configuration interface (which would allow to set certain
operation parameters locally or for the whole network).

&gt;<i>      Georg, in this test-bed that is mentioned in the website
</I>&gt;<i> (Magdeburger Open Source Tag (MOST)), how many nodes are participating
</I>&gt;<i> in the network? Is there any performance evaluation of AWDS over this
</I>&gt;<i> test-bed or even on a simulated / emulated network?
</I>
We used AWDS as a backbone network to provide internet connectivity for
a two-day conference in a university building. We deployed a dozen of
ALIX/WRAP nodes with 2x wifi - AWDS backbone on channel 36 and AP mode
on channels 1/6/11. There were some stability problems I could not quite
figure out, so I have mixed feelings about the setup.

This was the biggest real AWDS installation accessible by end-users. We
are running with five to 20 AWDS nodes in our own university building on
a day-by-day basis for different experiments and evaluation, which is
actually very reliable.

As AWDS can be setup on top of ns2, we also performed simulation studies
with an order of around 100 nodes, IIRC. Probably Andre can give more
details on that :)


Georg

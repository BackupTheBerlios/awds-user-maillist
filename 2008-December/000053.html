<PRE>Hello Georg,

2008/12/10 Georg Lukas &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/awds-user">georg at boerde.de</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> AWDS behaves like a transparent Ethernet switch between all the nodes in
</I>&gt;<i> a multi-hop network; that means that broadcast Ethernet frames
</I>&gt;<i> (including IP/UDP broadcast) are flooded through the network. Thus, they
</I>&gt;<i> have a high probability to reach even distant nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What kind of problems are you referring to?
</I>
       Yes, that's precisely what I needed to know. I'm working on an
heterogeneous network scenario, where I'll make a Bluetooth PAN
network, an 802.11g multihop ad hoc network and an ethernet network
talk to each other. This way, each  gateway for each of these IP
networks or even participating nodes must be able to flood some data
into these networks. Now, this simple on a single-hop scenario
(Ethernet and Bluetooth) within a single MAC domain, but in the case
of 802.11 it requires some form of multi-hop broadcast. So, AWDS will
provide me with the missing piece: I can flood a UDP packet to the
802.11 network and hope that all nodes will receive it, even if that
happens to be multi-hop (AWDS will handle it, as you said).

      So, I may assume that a simple ping, which results in an ARP
broadcast, will actually became an ARP flood? This is quite amazing to
me :).


&gt;&gt;<i>      Another question is: since AWDS uses ideas from OLSR, does it use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MPR for flooding?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The MPR approach has been implemented, but was disabled later on. The
</I>&gt;<i> reason for this is that generally, broadcast messaging is not very
</I>&gt;<i> reliable and has rather high probability of packet loss. When enabling
</I>&gt;<i> MPR in networks with low density (like typical WMNs or roof nets), the
</I>&gt;<i> flooding success is noticeably reduced. This conclusion was also made by
</I>&gt;<i> the Freifunk community, and IIRC the MPR mechanism is disabled there
</I>&gt;<i> too.
</I>
    Right, yes, I read a lot about the B.A.T.M.A.N. project and they
mention MPR limitations and the reason they are creating a new
protocol. By the way, if AWDS does not use MPR flooding optimizations
for flooding, does it use another mechanism? Because simple
rebroadcasts would lead to the classic broadcast storm problem.

    Lastly, is there any article on AWDS? It seems to be such as
amazing project that is not known in academia, as far as I know. I'll
certainly mention it in my master's dissertation, and if there isnt
anything written about it, I'll be glad to write an article or paper
about it.

&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Georg

<PRE>Hello Breno,

* Breno Jacinto &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/awds-user">breno at freeunix.com.br</A>&gt; [2008-12-21 01:20]:
&gt;<i>     Here I am asking a few more questions :). I was just wondering how
</I>&gt;<i> the protocol that operates on AWDS really works. On the website it is
</I>&gt;<i> stated that it is similar to OLSR, but was there anything written in
</I>&gt;<i> more detail about it, such as message formats, state machines etc? Or
</I>&gt;<i> everything just went straight to the code?
</I>
AWDS is a pro-active link-state routing protocol. It uses Ethernet
packets with type 0x8334, an according dissector for Wireshark can be
found on awds.berlios.de; If you are familiar with Scapy, you can read
the code in AWDScapy [1] to learn the packet format - it is pretty
straight forward.

&gt;<i>     Another question is, since any broadcast message is flooded to all
</I>&gt;<i> nodes on the network, how are neighbors (one-hop) determined? I mean,
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast is a simple and necessary way of finds who is next to you,
</I>&gt;<i> and it is useful to have this functionality, such as when working with
</I>&gt;<i> raw ethernet sockets (layer 2).  On the other hand, it is really nice
</I>&gt;<i> to assume that a simple broadcast is gonna reach everybody in the
</I>&gt;<i> network. So, I suppose there's something (a protocol code, maybe?)
</I>&gt;<i> inside AWDS which may policy this (?).
</I>
Yes, there is. Actually, there are three kinds of packets:

 a) multi-hop unicast data packets
 b) flood packets (which are used for IP/UDP broadcasts)
 c) local broadcasts (which are not forwarded in the network)

packet type c is used for determining neighbors: every station
periodically sends a beacon (&quot;hello&quot;) packet with its current neighbor
list; stations nearby can receive it and put the sender in their
neighborship; then they send their own beacon packet. However, this only
happens after a certain number of consecutive packets has been received.
This mechanism ensures that unidirectional and bad links are not used
for building the topology.

&gt;<i>     One last question: is there any interface so that a developer
</I>&gt;<i> willing to extract some data about an AWDS network (such as number of
</I>&gt;<i> nodes, one-hop neighbors, topology etc)  may do so? This is useful in
</I>&gt;<i> the case of writing something at layer 3, and taking some data from
</I>&gt;<i> layer 2.
</I>
There are several: you can enable AWDS_SHELL (which is insecure if other
people have access to your network) and connect to it with
&quot;telnet localhost 8444&quot;

You can use the topology viewer from the berlios repository; it is a
Java application using tcp port 8333 to receive the current topology as
well as topology changes in XML format. You can use that XML protocol
yourself to gather additional data or to process it:

Just connect to tcp port 8333 and send a &quot;x&quot; for XML ;)

P.S: I have created a #awds on freenode, where we can discuss things
with a shorter latency, at least when I am on. However my hosting
provider is having issues right now ;)

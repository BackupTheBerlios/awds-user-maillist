<PRE>Hello Georg,

&gt;&gt;<i> 2008/12/10 Georg Lukas &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/awds-user">georg at boerde.de</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       So, I may assume that a simple ping, which results in an ARP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> broadcast, will actually became an ARP flood? This is quite amazing to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly. Also, the tapiface2 module remembers the MAC address of the
</I>&gt;<i> sender and the according awds node MAC, so that the ARP reply (a
</I>&gt;<i> unicast) is automatically directed to the requester as a multi-hop
</I>&gt;<i> unicast packet.
</I>&gt;<i> Another mechanism forces the flooding of unicast packets when the
</I>&gt;<i> destination MAC is not known - this ensures that the destination is
</I>&gt;<i> reached, and also mimics Ethernet switch behaviour.
</I>
    Nice to know. This is some sort of optmization at this layer. I'd
really go into more details of AWDS routing.

&gt;&gt;<i> By the way, if AWDS does not use MPR flooding optimizations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for flooding, does it use another mechanism? Because simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rebroadcasts would lead to the classic broadcast storm problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed. However this problem is not that bad for mid-sized networks.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the AWDS topology updates are sent less frequently when the
</I>&gt;<i> network increases, which also helps mitigate broadcast storms.
</I>
    But then, the less Topolgy updates are sent, the less likely node
are able to build routes to each other? I mean, in situation where
node mobility is high, in dense or sparse networks,  more updates are
necessary, dont you think?


&gt;<i> The whole project has an academic background. However, the academic
</I>&gt;<i> value of the implementation of a mesh routing protocol is rather low.
</I>&gt;<i> Most of our academic works ([1, 2, 3]) use AWDS as their backbone, but do not
</I>&gt;<i> descend into the details of its working.
</I>
    I think you understimate the value of it :). For example, in my
line of research, in which we deal with heterogeneous networks
(Bluetooth, 802.11, Ethernet, GSM... etc), 802.11 ad hoc networks are
just one of a kind. And, actually, they are the only multi-hop network
(in a single broadcast domain) available. Thus, to route between these
networks, using IP would require the use of a protocol like OLSR,
which would have adaptations to work in a multi-domain network etc...
AWDS solves it at the underlay and simplifies a lot of integration
issues.

    Also, I dont know any other routing protocol acting at layer 2,
like AWDS. Other approaches close to yours are LUNAR
(<A HREF="http://cn.cs.unibas.ch/projects/lunar/">http://cn.cs.unibas.ch/projects/lunar/</A>) and Ana4
(<A HREF="http://ana4.citi.insa-lyon.fr/">http://ana4.citi.insa-lyon.fr/</A>). Both are discontinued, undocumented
projects that never reach some state-of-practice.

&gt;<i> Of course you are free to write a section in your thesis, or if you feel
</I>&gt;<i> free, we can cooperate on a tech report about how AWDS works :)
</I>
   Sure, I'd really need it. The documents on the site give a good
overview of how it works, but I'd like to go into details of the
mechanisms involved, advantages of working at layer 2, and especially,
comparing the layer 2 approach to layer 3 solutions such as OLSR.

&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Georg
</I>
best regards,

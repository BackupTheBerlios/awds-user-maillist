Subject: [Awds-user] On AWDS Routing
Message-ID: <2ced936d0901220749g1e779046h8cc30cf5e2ded3a7@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Georg, everyone,

    I'm writing a survey paper on underlay (below IP) networking, to
which AWDS will be covered as a layer 2 approach to 802.11 ad hoc
networks. I have some questions regarding AWDS compared to other
protocols, such as:

1) Is it possible to implement other algorithms other than the default
proactive link-state one?

2) Was there an specific reason to choose a link-state approach?

3) How is AWDS compared to 802.11s ?


     For this last question especially, it is interesting to compare
AWDS to 802.11s since they are attacking routing at layer 2, but while
802.11s will require new network adapters supporting the standard,
AWDS is doing something similar using off-the-shelf, commonly used
802.11 network interfaces.

regards,

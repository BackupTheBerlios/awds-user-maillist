Only to make it clear - you want to (1) replace the wireless links with an 
Ethernet cable? Or do you want to (2) combine the wireless mesh with a wired 
interface?

> I tried to modify start_awds script and launch rawbasic.so

Hmm - if you really want the version (1), you maybe did the right thing. But 
it's easier to modify the configuration file /etc/awds.conf 
or /usr/local/etc/awds.conf.

set
NET_DEV=eth0
and 
DEV_CHANGE_WIRELESS_SETTINGS=no

This should do it. 

If you want version (2), you must bridge the awds0 device with the ethernet 
device (eth0). Have a look at brctl. 

BTW: You should ask such questions on the awd-users mailing list. There are 
more nice guys that maybe will answer your question. 

Best regards,

Andr?

Dear All,

Do you know how to retrieve the forwarding table? Means how to now the
next hop to the destination in more then 1 hop secnario

Also, is it possible to apply a specific metric for the routing
(available bandwidth for instance)without modifying the code? 
  
Best Regards

Yes, I know ;-).
It should be possible via the shell. We only have to add some lines of code. 

... let's see .... 

Okay -- I've added a new command "topo nexthops". It dumps the information you 
want. 

Just connect to the awds shell (telnet localhost 8444), and enter 
"topo nexthops". Please make sure that the shell is enabled in the awds.conf.

First, you must get the latest version of my git tree
: git clone aland.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~aherms/awds-aherms.git

That's it. 

> Also, is it possible to apply a specific metric for the routing

Yes, it is. In theory, you can load an arbitrary metric module in start_awds. 
There are already some metrics like ETX (Expected Transmit Count) or RTT 
(Round Trip Time). You only have to load the corresponding module. 
If you want to have you own metric (like something that considers bandwidth) 
you have to write a new metric module. 

If you have further questions, go on and ask. 

Regards,

Andr?

Dear All,

Is there someone who already used the debugging shell. Actually I tried nc localhost 8444 and I get connection refused. I took a look using netstat on what is running on port 8444 and it seems nothing is there

Any idea

Best Regards

We use it every day.

Are you sure that it is enabled in the /etc/awds.conf? I think it is disabled 
by default.

Someone deal already with the bridge issues? For me it didn't work. The bridge seems to set up correctly, but when I launch awds over the bridge the system crash

Any help is appreciated

I finaly fix this problem paertially, the system didn't crash. Actually, some parameters were not correctly set up in my kernel. However, it the seems that wireless/wired bridge under linux didn't work at all (you can google on that). Therefore only the wired cards is visible by awds.

So, I have two qsuestions:

- is there here anyone who already deal with this problem?
- Why not modifying awds to allow it to work on serveral interfaces in parallel (something like start_awds eth0 ath0 for instance). I used OLSR (at IP level), and the protocol manage this very well

Any help is much appreciated

Best regards

Yes, you can not bridge Ethernet and Wireless links together, unless the
Wireless one is WDS or Access Point.

Could you please describe the scenario you want to construct? From your
questions it does not become clear, but it seems you are trying to do it
in the wrong way.

> - is there here anyone who already deal with this problem?

For my part, I always run awds on the wireless device (ath0), and then
bridge the virtual awds device awds0 to the Ethernet device eth0.

Theoretically, this should be the same as creating a non-forwarding
bridge on the required interfaces and run awds on the logical bridge.
I am not sure though, if the feature request can easily be implemented.


Kind regards,

Georg

Bridging works well with a wireless interface in master mode (act as AP). This 
is the usual way of implementing a WLAN AP. There could be a problem with the 
ad-hoc mode. But I'm not sure about this. Theoretically, something like the 
following should work.
   AWDS               AWDS              AWDS
     |                  |                |
     |              -- br0 ---           |
     |             |          |          | 
  wlan0 -------- wlan0      eth0 ------ eth0 

However, I haven't tried this. Georg sometimes claims that it could clash with 
the three-address scheme of the ad-hoc mode. Maybe. 

> - is there here anyone who already deal with this problem?
We haven't tried the scenario above. A student of us developed an extension 
for multichannel-wireless with multiple interfaces. I think this is not the 
way you want it.

Of course, we could do it the same way as OLSR. It requires some small changes 
in the routing. I think a small hack in the rawbasic.so module could do it. 

Are you interested in hacking it?

Andr?
